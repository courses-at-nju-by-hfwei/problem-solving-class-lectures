  \begin{exampleblock}{Fish Recurrence (Problem $4.2-8$)}
    At the end of each year, a state fish hatchery puts $2000$ fish into a lake. \\[6pt]

    The number of fish in the lake at the beginning of the year doubles by the end of the year 
    due to reproduction. \\[6pt]
    
    Give a recurrence for the number of fish in the lake after $n$ years, and solve the recurrence.
  \end{exampleblock}

  \pause
  \[
    T(n) = \# \text{ of fish at the end of the } n\text{-th year}
  \]

  \pause
  \[
    T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 2000
  \]

  \pause
  \[
    T(0) = 2000

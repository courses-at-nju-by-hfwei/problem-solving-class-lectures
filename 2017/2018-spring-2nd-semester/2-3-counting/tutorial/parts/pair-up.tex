  \begin{exampleblock}{Paring up ($\text{CS}: 1.2-15$)}
    A tennis club has $2n$ members. 
    We want to pair up the members by twos for singles matches. 
    
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
      \item In how many ways can we pair up all the members of the club? 
      \item Suppose that in addition to specifying who plays whom, 
	we also determine who serves first for each pairing. 
	In how many ways can we specify our pairs?
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{exampleblock}

    \frac{(2n)!}{2^{n}} \;\red{\text{\emph{vs.}}}\; \frac{(2n)!}{2^n \cdot \red{n!}} \pause \qquad \teal{(\text{take}\; n = 2:\; \set{A, B, C, D})}

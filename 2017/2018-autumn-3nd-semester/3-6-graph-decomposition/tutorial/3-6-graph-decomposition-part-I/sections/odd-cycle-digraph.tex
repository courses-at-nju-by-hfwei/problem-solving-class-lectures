    Find an odd cycle in a digraph $G$.

  \begin{lemma}
    A digraph $G$ has an odd directed cycle $\iff$ $\exists \text{scc}: $ scc is non-bipartite (when treated undirected).
  \end{lemma}

  \begin{alertblock}{Question}
	To prove the lemma and design an algorithm.
  \end{alertblock}
  \begin{proof}
    $\Longleftarrow$: undirected $C$; oriented
      \begin{itemize}
    	\item odd directed cycle
    	\item choose a direction $\forall u \to v$: $\text{Len}(v \leadsto u)$ 
      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{The Original Counterfeit Coin Problem}
  \begin{quote}
    You have \blue{eight} similar coins and a beam balance.

    \blue{At most one} coin is counterfeit and hence underweight.

    How can you detect whether there is an underweight coin, 

    and if so, which one, using the balance only \blue{twice}? \\[8pt]
